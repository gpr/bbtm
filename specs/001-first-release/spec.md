# Feature Specification: Blood Bowl Tournament Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-first-release`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a web application with a React Frontend, and using firebase that will allow to manage bloodbowl tournament this is a first phase of the application where a application user can create a tournament and let coaches register themself by providing their alias (mandatory), their full name (optional), their email address (mandatory) and their NAF number (optional), the team race (mandatory) and the team name (optional). It should be possible to user to register first to the application or to use an anonymous form."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a tournament organizer, I want to create Blood Bowl tournaments and allow coaches to register themselves with their team information, so that I can manage tournament participation efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new user, **When** I visit the application, **Then** I can either register as a user or access an anonymous registration form
2. **Given** I am a registered user, **When** I create a new tournament, **Then** the tournament is saved and available for coach registration
3. **Given** a tournament exists, **When** a coach provides their mandatory information (alias, email, team race), **Then** they are successfully registered for the tournament
4. **Given** a coach is registering, **When** they provide optional information (full name, NAF number, team name), **Then** this information is captured and stored with their registration
5. **Given** a coach uses the anonymous form, **When** they complete registration with all mandatory fields, **Then** they are registered without creating a user account

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a coach tries to register with an already used alias for the same tournament?
- How does the system handle duplicate email addresses for the same tournament?
- What happens if a coach tries to register for a tournament that is already full or closed?
- How does the system validate NAF numbers when provided?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to register accounts or use anonymous forms
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow registered users to create tournaments
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow coaches to register for tournaments using either user accounts or anonymous forms
- **FR-004**: System MUST require coach alias, email address, and team race as mandatory fields during registration to a tournament
- **FR-005**: System MUST accept optional information including full name, NAF number, and team name during coach registration to a tournament
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate email address format during account creation or tournament registration
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent duplicate coach aliases within the same tournament
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist all tournament and registration data
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a way to view registered coaches for a tournament
- **FR-010**: System MUST authenticate users for account creation and tournament management

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents registered application users who can create tournaments; includes authentication credentials and profile information
- **Tournament**: Represents a Blood Bowl tournament event; includes tournament details, registration status, and participant list
- **Coach Registration**: Represents a coach's registration for a specific tournament; includes mandatory fields (alias, email, team race) and optional fields (full name, NAF number, team name)
- **Team**: Represents a coach's Blood Bowl team; includes race (mandatory) and name (optional)
