# Research: Blood Bowl Tournament Management System

**Date**: 2025-09-20
**Feature**: Blood Bowl Tournament Management System
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Technical Decisions

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework: React 18+
**Decision**: React with TypeScript for the frontend application
**Rationale**:
- Mature ecosystem with extensive community support
- Excellent TypeScript integration for type safety
- Large library of components and utilities
- Strong developer tooling and debugging capabilities
- Good performance with React 18 concurrent features

**Alternatives considered**:
- Vue.js: Good but smaller ecosystem
- Svelte: Fast but less mature ecosystem
- Angular: Too heavy for this use case

### Backend-as-a-Service: Firebase
**Decision**: Firebase for backend services (Authentication, Firestore, Hosting)
**Rationale**:
- Rapid development with minimal backend code
- Built-in authentication with multiple providers
- Real-time database capabilities with Firestore
- Automatic scaling and infrastructure management
- Good free tier for MVP development

**Alternatives considered**:
- Supabase: Good alternative but newer ecosystem
- AWS Amplify: More complex setup
- Custom Node.js backend: More development overhead

### Database: Firestore
**Decision**: Firestore (NoSQL document database)
**Rationale**:
- Native integration with Firebase ecosystem
- Real-time synchronization capabilities
- Offline support (future enhancement)
- Flexible document structure for tournament/coach data
- Built-in security rules

**Alternatives considered**:
- Firebase Realtime Database: Less advanced querying
- PostgreSQL: Would require custom backend

### UI Component Library: Mantine
**Decision**: Mantine for component library (constitutional requirement)
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional mandate for standardized toolchain
- Comprehensive component set with modern design
- Excellent TypeScript support out of the box
- Built-in accessibility features
- Integrated form handling and validation
- Dark theme support
- Active development and strong documentation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Material-UI (MUI): Good but not constitutional standard
- Ant Design: More enterprise-focused
- Chakra UI: Simpler but less comprehensive

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Jest + React Testing Library + Cypress
**Rationale**:
- Jest for unit tests (standard React ecosystem)
- React Testing Library for component testing (better than Enzyme)
- Cypress for end-to-end integration tests
- Firebase emulator for testing Firebase integration

**Alternatives considered**:
- Playwright: Good but newer, less React-specific tooling
- Testing Library + MSW: Good for API mocking but Firebase has emulator

### State Management
**Decision**: React Context + useReducer for global state
**Rationale**:
- Sufficient for moderate complexity
- No additional dependencies
- Good TypeScript integration
- Easy to upgrade to Redux Toolkit if needed

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux Toolkit: Overkill for initial scope
- Zustand: Good but another dependency
- Recoil: Experimental Facebook project

### Routing
**Decision**: React Router v6
**Rationale**:
- Standard React routing solution
- Good TypeScript support
- Nested routing capabilities
- Active development

**Alternatives considered**:
- Next.js: Would change overall architecture significantly
- Reach Router: Merged into React Router

### Form Handling
**Decision**: React Hook Form + Zod for validation
**Rationale**:
- Excellent performance (uncontrolled components)
- Good TypeScript integration
- Zod provides runtime validation with TypeScript inference
- Less re-renders compared to Formik

**Alternatives considered**:
- Formik: More re-renders, performance concerns
- Native form handling: Too much boilerplate

### Development Tooling
**Decision**: Vite for build tooling
**Rationale**:
- Faster development server than Create React App
- Better TypeScript support out of the box
- More modern bundling approach
- Good plugin ecosystem

**Alternatives considered**:
- Create React App: Slower development experience
- Webpack from scratch: Too much configuration overhead

## Architecture Patterns

### Authentication Flow
**Pattern**: Firebase Authentication with context provider
**Implementation**:
- AuthContext to provide user state globally
- Protected routes using custom hooks
- Automatic token refresh handling
- Anonymous access for tournament registration

### Data Fetching
**Pattern**: Custom hooks with Firebase SDK
**Implementation**:
- Custom hooks for each data operation (useTournaments, useRegistrations)
- Real-time listeners for live data updates
- Error handling and loading states
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### Error Handling
**Pattern**: Error boundaries + notification system
**Implementation**:
- React Error Boundaries for unhandled errors
- Global notification context for user-facing messages
- Structured error logging to Firebase Analytics

### Security Considerations
**Pattern**: Firestore Security Rules + client-side validation
**Implementation**:
- Strict Firestore rules preventing unauthorized access
- Client-side validation as UX enhancement
- Input sanitization for all user inputs
- Rate limiting through Firebase security rules

## Performance Optimizations

### Code Splitting
- Route-based code splitting with React.lazy
- Component-level splitting for large components
- Third-party library splitting

### Bundle Optimization
- Tree shaking for unused code elimination
- Dynamic imports for non-critical features
- Compression and minification in production

### Data Loading
- Firestore query optimization (indexes, pagination)
- Real-time listener optimization
- Image optimization for any uploaded content

## Development Workflow

### Version Control
- Git flow with feature branches
- Conventional commits for clear history
- Pull request reviews for quality control

### CI/CD
- Firebase Hosting for automatic deployments
- GitHub Actions for testing and deployment
- Environment-specific Firebase projects (dev/staging/prod)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for user workflows
- Firebase emulator for testing backend integration

## Risk Mitigation

### Firebase Vendor Lock-in
- Abstract Firebase calls behind service interfaces
- Document data models for potential migration
- Use standard authentication patterns

### Scalability Concerns
- Monitor Firebase quotas and pricing
- Design with horizontal scaling in mind
- Plan for potential backend migration if needed

### Security Risks
- Implement comprehensive Firestore security rules
- Regular security audits of authentication flow
- Input validation and sanitization everywhere

## Next Steps
All technical decisions resolved - ready for Phase 1 design phase.
